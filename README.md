# json-parser-beautify
This script came up while trying to go through a 5 GB dataset with json data. There was a need to sift throught the json attributes in a nice looking (indented, spaced) json format to understand it better. This would then be represented it in an ER diagram. 

# How to use (works with python 2.7 and python 3)

NOTE: download the file `parse.py` in the same working directory as your json files then run the following commands from terminal or unix shell

`$cd your_work_directory`

`$python3 parse.py your_file_name.json`

## Examples -
`$python3 parse.py business.json`  
`$python3 parse.py review.json`    
`$python3 parse.py user.json`     
`$python3 parse.py checkin.json`
